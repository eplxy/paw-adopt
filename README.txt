My entire assignment will be available on pawadopt.azurewebsites.net
You should be able to access questions 1, 2, and 3 by going to pawadopt.azurewebsites.net/Q123
The petstore website is available at pawadopt.azurewebsites.net itself.

However, in the instance that it does not work for you, please use my zip file submission.
Please open the folder in a terminal like cmd and then install the modules by running 'npm install'.
Once ready, run 'node app.js' under the unzipped folder
This will simultaneously run the petstore, viewable at http://localhost:3001
and the questions 1 through 3 viewable at http://localhost:3000/Q123

Thanks for marking my assignment!
