# PAW Adopt
PAW Adopt is a web app built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, as an assignment submission for my university web programming class.
This was my first ever attempt at web programming.

It uses Node.js and Express.js, and is currently (as of May 2024) being hosted on https://pawadopt.azurewebsites.net/
